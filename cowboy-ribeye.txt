:revdate: 2025-09-25
:author: Grok 3, xAI

== Description
A tender, juicy bone-in cowboy ribeye (3.09 lbs) seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic, and fresh rosemary, cooked low-and-slow in a café oven at 225°F to 130°F (medium-rare) using the oven's auto-shutoff meat thermometer, then reverse-seared for a flavorful crust. Serves 4-6 people.

== Ingredients
* 1 cowboy ribeye steak (bone-in, 3.09 lbs, ~2-2.5 inches thick)
* 1.5-2 tbsp kosher salt
* 1.5 tsp freshly ground black pepper
* 1.5 tsp garlic powder
* 1.5-2 tbsp fresh rosemary, finely chopped (from garden, or 1.5 tsp dried)
* 1 tbsp olive oil or avocado oil (for searing)
* 2 tbsp unsalted butter (for searing)
* 1 sprig fresh rosemary (optional, for basting)
* 1 clove garlic, smashed (optional, for basting)

== Equipment
* Café oven (with meat thermometer probe and auto-shutoff feature)
* Wire rack set over a baking sheet
* Cast-iron skillet or oven-safe skillet
* Meat thermometer probe (included with café oven)
* Tongs

== Preparation
. *Prepare the Steak*:
.. Pat the ribeye dry with paper towels.
.. Mix 1.5-2 tbsp kosher salt, 1.5 tsp black pepper, 1.5 tsp garlic powder, and 1.5-2 tbsp finely chopped fresh rosemary in a small bowl.
.. Rub the mixture evenly over all sides of the steak, pressing gently to adhere.
.. Place the steak on a wire rack over a baking sheet and refrigerate uncovered for 1 hour to dry-brine.

. *Preheat Oven*:
.. Preheat café oven to 225°F (convection optional for even heat).
.. Ensure the oven’s meat thermometer probe is ready.

. *Cook Low and Slow*:
.. Place the wire rack with the steak on the baking sheet in the oven.
.. Insert the oven’s meat thermometer probe into the thickest part of the steak, avoiding the bone.
.. Set the oven’s target temperature to 130°F (medium-rare). Expect 1.5-2.5 hours for the oven to shut off automatically when the steak reaches 130°F.
.. *Doneness Options*:
... Rare: 120-125°F (49-52°C)
... Medium: 135-140°F (57-60°C)

. *Rest*:
.. Remove the steak from the oven when it hits 130°F.
.. Rest on the wire rack, loosely covered with foil, for 10-15 minutes to redistribute juices.

. *Sear*:
.. Heat a cast-iron skillet over high heat until very hot (3-4 minutes). Add 1 tbsp olive oil and wait until it shimmers.
.. Sear the steak for 3-4 minutes per side to develop a deep golden-brown crust.
.. Add 2 tbsp butter, 1 rosemary sprig, and 1 smashed garlic clove (if using) during the last minute, tilting the pan and spooning melted butter over the steak.
.. Sear edges for 30-45 seconds each using tongs.

. *Rest and Serve*:
.. Rest the steak for 5-7 minutes after searing.
.. Slice against the grain or serve whole with the bone, drizzled with pan juices.

== Notes
* *Café Oven*: The auto-shutoff feature ensures precise cooking. Place the probe in the thickest meaty part, away from the bone, for accurate readings.
* *Fresh Rosemary*: Use garden-fresh rosemary for the rub and optional basting. Increase to 2.5 tbsp in the rub for stronger flavor if desired.
* *Grill Option*: After the oven, sear on a grill preheated to 450-500°F for 3-4 minutes per side.
* *Sides*: Pair with mashed potatoes (2-3 lbs for 4-6 people), sautéed spinach, or roasted acorn squash for a Southern-style meal.
* *Servings*: A 3.09-lb ribeye serves 4-6 (8-12 oz per person).

== Prep and Cook Time
* *Prep Time*: 10 minutes + 1 hour chilling
* *Cook Time*: 1.5-2.5 hours (oven) + 5-8 minutes (searing)
* *Total Time*: ~2-2.75 hours
