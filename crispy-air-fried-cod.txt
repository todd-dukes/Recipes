:description: A healthier adaptation of Culver's crispy, golden fried cod, using an air fryer to achieve a crunchy coating with minimal oil.

== Description
This recipe adapts Culver's-style crispy cod for the air fryer, using cod loins from Sam's Club. A seasoned batter and light oil spray create a golden, crunchy exterior with tender, flaky fish inside. Perfect with tartar sauce and lemon wedges!

== Ingredients
* *Cod*:
** 4 cod loins (4–6 oz each, thawed), patted dry
* *Batter*:
** 1 cup all-purpose flour
** 1/4 cup cornstarch
** 1 tsp baking powder
** 1 tsp salt
** 1/2 tsp black pepper
** 1/2 tsp paprika
** 1/4 tsp garlic powder
** 1/4 tsp onion powder
** 3/4–1 cup cold club soda or light lager beer (adjust for thick batter)
* *Dredge*:
** 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
** 1/2 tsp salt
** 1/4 tsp black pepper
* *For Air Frying and Serving*:
** Cooking spray or 1–2 tbsp vegetable oil (for brushing)
** Lemon wedges (optional, for serving)
** Tartar sauce (optional, for serving)

== Equipment
* Air fryer
* Tongs
* Pastry brush or oil sprayer
* Mixing bowls
* Wire rack or plate

== Instructions
. *Prep the Cod*:
** Pat cod loins dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture (critical for crispiness).
** Season lightly with a pinch of salt and pepper.
. *Set Up Dredge and Batter*:
** In a shallow dish, mix 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp black pepper for the dredge.
** In a medium bowl, whisk together 1 cup flour, cornstarch, baking powder, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder. Slowly add cold club soda or beer, whisking until smooth. Aim for a thick batter (like heavy cream) to ensure it sticks in the air fryer.
. *Coat the Cod*:
** Dredge each cod loin in the flour mixture, shaking off excess.
** Dip into the batter, ensuring full coverage. Let excess batter drip off. For extra adhesion, gently press batter onto the fish.
. *Preheat Air Fryer*:
** Preheat air fryer to 390&#176;F (200&#176;C) for 3 minutes (or per your air fryer’s instructions).
. *Air Fry the Cod*:
** Lightly spray or brush both sides of each battered cod loin with vegetable oil to promote browning.
** Place 1–2 loins in the air fryer basket in a single layer, ensuring they don’t touch (work in batches if needed).
** Air fry at 390&#176;F for 8–12 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden and crispy. Internal temperature should reach 145&#176;F (63&#176;C).
** Remove with tongs and place on a wire rack or plate.
. *Serve*:
** Serve immediately with lemon wedges and tartar sauce. Pair with fries or coleslaw for the full Culver's experience.

[NOTE]
====
* *Keep Batter Thick*: Use slightly less liquid (3/4 cup) for a thicker batter that adheres better in the air fryer.
* *Oil Spray*: Don’t skip the oil spray or brush; it’s essential for a crispy, golden coating.
* *Batch Cooking*: Avoid overcrowding the air fryer basket to ensure even cooking.
* *Freshness*: Use thawed cod loins (cold water method: 30–60 min in a sealed bag). Pat dry thoroughly.
