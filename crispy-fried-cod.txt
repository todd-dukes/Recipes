:description: A recipe to replicate Culver's crispy, golden fried cod using cod loins from Sam's Club, featuring a light, crunchy batter and tender, flaky fish.

== Description
This recipe mimics the crispy, flavorful North Atlantic cod served at Culver's. With a seasoned batter and deep-frying technique, these cod loins from Sam's Club turn into a golden, crunchy delight. Perfect with tartar sauce and lemon wedges!

== Ingredients
Serves 4

* *Cod*:
** 4 cod loins (about 4-6 oz each), patted dry
* *Batter*:
** 1 cup all-purpose flour
** 1/4 cup cornstarch
** 1 tsp baking powder
** 1 tsp salt
** 1/2 tsp black pepper
** 1/2 tsp paprika
** 1/4 tsp garlic powder
** 1/4 tsp onion powder
** 1 cup cold club soda or light lager beer
* *Dredge*:
** 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
** 1/2 tsp salt
** 1/4 tsp black pepper
* *For Frying and Serving*:
** Vegetable oil (enough for 2-3 inches in a deep skillet or pot)
** Lemon wedges (optional, for serving)
** Tartar sauce (optional, for serving)

== Equipment
* Deep skillet or Dutch oven
* Thermometer (for oil temperature)
* Tongs or slotted spoon
* Wire rack or paper towels

== Instructions
. *Prep the Cod*:
** Pat cod loins dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture.
** Season lightly with a pinch of salt and pepper.
. *Set Up Dredge and Batter*:
** In a shallow dish, mix 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp black pepper for the dredge.
** In a medium bowl, whisk together 1 cup flour, cornstarch, baking powder, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder. Slowly add cold club soda or beer, whisking until smooth (batter should be like pancake batter). Keep batter cold.
. *Heat Oil*:
** Pour oil into a deep skillet or Dutch oven to a depth of 2-3 inches. Heat to 350°F (175°C) over medium-high heat, using a thermometer to maintain temperature.
. *Coat the Cod*:
** Dredge each cod loin in the flour mixture, shaking off excess.
** Dip into the batter, ensuring full coverage. Let excess batter drip off.
. *Fry the Cod*:
** Carefully place 1-2 loins in the hot oil (avoid overcrowding). Fry for 3-4 minutes per side, turning once, until golden brown and crispy. Internal temperature should reach 145°F (63°C).
** Remove with tongs or a slotted spoon and place on a wire rack or paper towels to drain. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt while hot.
. *Serve*:
** Serve immediately with lemon wedges and tartar sauce. Pair with fries or coleslaw for the full Culver's experience.

[NOTE]
====
* *Keep Batter Cold*: Use cold club soda or beer for a crispier coating. A light lager best mimics Culver's flavor.
* *Oil Temperature*: Maintain 350°F to avoid greasy or burnt fish.
* *Freshness*: Ensure cod loins are fresh or fully thawed for best texture.
* *No Deep Fryer?*: A deep skillet works well; monitor oil depth and temperature.
