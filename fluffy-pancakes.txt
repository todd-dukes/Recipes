This recipe yields approximately 6 ultra-fluffy pancakes using a buttermilk substitute, powdered sugar, and whipped egg whites for maximum lightness. Cooked on a 350{deg}F griddle, these pancakes are tender with a subtle sweetness and tang.

== Ingredients
* 0.75 cup all-purpose flour (optional: add 1-2 tsp if batter is too thin)
* 1.75 tsp baking powder
* 0.25 tsp salt
* 1 tsp powdered sugar
* 0.5 cup + 2 tbsp milk
* 1.5 tsp white vinegar
* 0.5 large egg yolk (from 1 large egg, separated)
* 2 large egg whites (from 2 large eggs)
* 1.5 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
* 0.5 tsp vanilla extract (optional)

== Instructions
. *Prepare buttermilk substitute*: In a small bowl, mix 0.5 cup + 2 tbsp milk with 1.5 tsp white vinegar. Let sit for 5-10 minutes until slightly curdled.
. *Mix dry ingredients*: In a medium bowl, whisk 0.75 cup flour, 1.75 tsp baking powder, 0.25 tsp salt, and 1 tsp powdered sugar.
. *Prepare wet ingredients*: 
  ** Separate one large egg; reserve 0.5 yolk (~0.5 tbsp). 
  ** In a small bowl, whisk the 0.5 egg yolk, 1.5 tbsp melted butter, 0.5 tsp vanilla (if using), and the milk-vinegar mixture until combined.
. *Whip egg whites*:
  ** In a clean, dry bowl, use a whisk or hand mixer to whip 2 large egg whites to *soft peaks* (foamy, holding shape but not stiff), about 2-3 minutes by hand or 1-2 minutes with a mixer. Ensure no yolk or grease in the bowl.
. *Make batter*:
  ** Pour the yolk-milk mixture into the dry ingredients. Stir gently until just combined; lumps are okay. Do not overmix.
  ** Gently *fold* the whipped egg whites into the batter using a spatula. Use slow, deliberate folds (10-12 folds) to retain air. The batter will be light and airy.
  ** If the batter seems too runny, add 1-2 tsp flour and stir gently.
. *Heat griddle*: Preheat griddle to *350{deg}F*. Test with a drop of water (it should sizzle and evaporate). Lightly grease with butter or oil.
. *Cook pancakes*: Pour ~0.25 cup batter per pancake onto the griddle. Cook until bubbles form and edges look set, about 2-3 minutes. Flip carefully (batter is delicate) and cook for 1-2 minutes until golden brown.
. *Serve*: Serve immediately with maple syrup, fresh fruit, or your favorite toppings.

== Tips for Success
* *Separating Eggs*: Crack eggs carefully to separate whites and yolk. For 0.5 yolk, scoop half the yolk from one egg or measure ~0.5 tbsp. Store unused yolk/white for another use (e.g., custard or meringue).
* *Whipping Whites*: Use a clean, grease-free bowl and whisk. Soft peaks are easier to fold and sufficient. Overwhipping to stiff peaks may make folding harder.
* *Batter Consistency*: Two egg whites make the batter wetter. Test one pancake; if it spreads too much, add 1-2 tsp flour to thicken.
* *Griddle at 350{deg}F*: Maintain this temperature. If pancakes brown too fast, lower to 340{deg}F. Ensure the griddle is fully preheated for even cooking.
* *Resting Batter*: Rest the batter for 5 minutes after folding in whites to stabilize the structure and enhance fluffiness.

== Expected Outcomes
* *Texture*: Ultra-fluffy and light due to two whipped egg whites, with a tender crumb from reduced yolk.
* *Flavor*: Mild egg flavor (less yolk), subtle tang from vinegar-milk, and gentle sweetness from powdered sugar.
* *Appearance*: Tall, golden pancakes that may spread slightly due to wetter batter.
* *Yield*: ~6 pancakes using ~0.25 cup batter each.
* *Cooking*: Slightly longer cooking time (extra 15 seconds per side) due to wetter batter. Flip gently to avoid deflating.

Enjoy your super-fluffy pancakes!
