This recipe yields approximately 6 to 9 ultra-fluffy pancakes using a buttermilk substitute, powdered sugar, and whipped egg whites for maximum lightness. Cooked on a 350{deg}F griddle, these pancakes are tender with a subtle sweetness and tang.

=== Ingredients
* Wet
** 5 oz (1/2 cup + 2 tbsp) milk
** 2 tsp white vinegar or lemon juice
** 2 large egg - yolks and whites will be separated. Only 1 yolk is used.
** 2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
** 1/2 tsp vanilla extract (optional - cooks same with 1tsp but has more dominate vanilla flavor)
* Dry
** 3/4 cup all-purpose flour (optional: add 1-2 tsp after mixing if batter is too thin)
** 2 tsp baking powder (1.5-2 tsp, but should with amount of vinegar or lemon juice you put in the milk)
** 1/4 tsp salt
** 1 tsp powdered sugar

=== Instructions
. *Prepare buttermilk substitute*: In a small bowl, mix 5 oz milk with 2 tsp white vinegar. **Let sit for at least 5 minutes. It should slightly curdle.**
. *Mix dry ingredients*: In a medium bowl, whisk 3/4 cup flour, 2 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp salt, and 1 tsp powdered sugar.
. *Prepare wet ingredients*:
  ** Separate eggs.
  *** Save egg whites in separate mixing bowl. We will whip just before folding into batter.
  *** Discard one egg yolk
  *** Save one egg yolk in small bowl. Whisk lightly and add to wet ingredients. (Do this at least 5 minutes after adding vinegar or lemon juice)
  ** In a small bowl or cup, melt butter. Stir wet ingredients while pouring in melted butter.
  ** stir 1/2 tsp vanilla into wet ingredients.
. *Make batter*:
  ** Pour the yolk-milk mixture into the dry ingredients. Stir gently until just combined; lumps are okay. Do not overmix.
. *Whip egg whites*:
  ** In a clean, dry bowl, use a whisk or hand mixer to whip 2 large egg whites to *soft peaks* (foamy, holding shape but not stiff), about 2-3 minutes by hand or 1-2 minutes with a mixer. Ensure no yolk or grease in the bowl to get light whipped result.
. ** Gently *fold* the whipped egg whites into the batter using a spatula. Use slow, deliberate folds (10-12 folds) to retain air. The batter will be light and airy.
  ** If the batter seems too runny, add 1-2 tsp flour and stir gently.
. *Heat griddle*: Preheat griddle to *350{deg}F*. Test with a drop of water (it should sizzle and evaporate). Lightly grease with butter or oil.
. *Cook pancakes*: Pour ~1/4 cup batter per pancake onto the griddle. Cook until bubbles form and edges look set, about 2-3 minutes. Flip carefully (batter is delicate) and cook for 1-2 minutes until golden brown.
. *Serve*: Can be kept while cooking in 200{deg} oven or serve immediately with maple syrup, fresh fruit, or your favorite toppings.

=== Tips for Success
* *Separating Eggs*: Crack eggs carefully to separate whites and yolk. Store unused yolk for another use (e.g., custard or meringue) or discard.
* *Whipping Whites*: Use a clean, grease-free bowl and whisk. Soft peaks are easier to fold and sufficient. Overwhipping to stiff peaks may make folding harder.
* *Batter Consistency*: Two egg whites make the batter wetter. Test one pancake; if it spreads too much, add 1-2 tsp flour to thicken.
* *Griddle at 350{deg}F*: Maintain this temperature. If pancakes brown too fast, lower to 340{deg}F. Ensure the griddle is fully preheated for even cooking.
* *Resting Batter*: Rest the batter for 5 minutes after folding in whites to stabilize the structure and enhance fluffiness.

=== Expected Outcomes
* *Texture*: Ultra-fluffy and light due to two whipped egg whites, with a tender crumb from reduced yolk.
* *Flavor*: Mild egg flavor (less yolk), subtle tang from vinegar-milk, and gentle sweetness from powdered sugar.
* *Appearance*: Tall, golden pancakes that may spread slightly due to wetter batter.
* *Yield*: ~6 pancakes using ~0.25 cup batter each.
* *Cooking*: Slightly longer cooking time (extra 15 seconds per side) due to wetter batter. Flip gently to avoid deflating.

Enjoy your super-fluffy pancakes!
