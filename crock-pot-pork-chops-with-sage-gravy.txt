== Description
This recipe is tailored for 24.9 oz of bone-in pork chops, serving 3-4 people. It features a rich, sage-infused gravy with garlic powder and a touch of vinegar for brightness, cooked to tender perfection in a crock pot.

== Ingredients
* 24.9 oz bone-in pork chops (about 3-4 chops)
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* Salt and black pepper, to taste
* 1 small onion, sliced
* 1/4 tsp garlic powder
* 1.5 cups low-sodium chicken broth
* 3/4 cup heavy cream
* 1.5 tbsp all-purpose flour
* 8 fresh sage leaves, finely chopped (plus extra for garnish)
* 1/2 tsp apple cider vinegar or white vinegar
* 1/2 tsp smoked paprika (optional)
* Pinch of cayenne pepper (optional)

== Instructions
. Prep Pork Chops: Pat chops dry with paper towels. Season generously with salt and pepper on both sides.
. Sear: Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Sear chops for 3-4 minutes per side until golden. Transfer to crock pot.
. Saute Onion: In the same skillet, cook onion for 3-4 minutes until soft. Transfer to crock pot.
. Make Gravy Base: In a bowl, whisk together broth, heavy cream, flour, chopped sage, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp vinegar, smoked paprika, and cayenne (if using) until smooth. Pour over chops.
. Cook: Cover and cook on LOW for 6-7 hours or HIGH for 3-4 hours, until tender (internal temperature 145F/63C).
. Finish Gravy: Remove chops to a plate. Stir gravy; if too thin, transfer to a saucepan and simmer for 5-10 minutes to thicken. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.
. Serve: Spoon gravy over chops. Garnish with fresh sage leaves. Serve with mashed potatoes or roasted vegetables.

== Notes
* For thicker gravy, mix 1 tbsp cornstarch with 2 tbsp cold water and stir into crock pot 30 minutes before finishing.
* The 1/2 tsp vinegar adds a subtle tang to replace Dijon mustard's flavor.
* Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on stovetop with a splash of broth.
* Fresh sage is key for flavor; dried sage (1/2 tsp) can substitute but is less vibrant.

Enjoy your tender pork chops with rich, sage-infused gravy!
