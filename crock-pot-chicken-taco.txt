* 1 tsp onion powder
* 1 tsp dried oregano

== Instructions

. *Prep the Crock Pot*: Place chicken breasts at the bottom of the slow cooker.

. *Serve*: Use the chicken mixture for tacos, burritos, bowls, or salads. Add toppings like cheese, cilantro, sour cream, or avocado as desired.

== Notes

* *Adjust spice*: For more heat, add a pinch of cayenne pepper or a diced jalapeno to the spice blend.
* *Storage*: Refrigerate leftovers for up to 4 days or freeze for up to 3 months.
* *Serving suggestion*: Serve with warm tortillas, rice, or a side of Mexican street corn.
